# SignalR_Kit

When starting a new project, developers are always trying to answer the following questions: 
* “Where to start?”
* “What are the basic steps for making things work?”
* “How can I set up everything so that it fits my requirements?”

This repo should help your with setting up SignalR on your project. It includes the following:
1.       Configure serialization of requests and responses
2.       Standardized responses
3.       Authorization 
4.       Validation 
5.       Exception handling
6.       Dependency injection
